# Pathfinder Visualizer

A web-based visualizer for pathfinding algorithms like A\*, Dijkstra, BFS, and DFS. Watch how these algorithms traverse through a grid to find the shortest path between two points in real-time.

## Features

- Visualize popular pathfinding algorithms
- Create walls and weighted nodes
- Interactive grid with click-and-drag support
- Reset and regenerate maze options

## Algorithms Implemented

- A\* (A Star)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
